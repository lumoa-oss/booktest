Book test addresses problems with data science RnD workflow and regression testing. 

In data science: 

1. There are often no right/wrong answers, but good/bad answers.  This emphasizes a need to see and compare changes in results 2. the data is big and state preparations are costly 3. At the same time, there is a need for regression testing 

For this reason, there is a need for a tool, that handles ability to see results and the cacheing as nicely as the Jupyter notebook, but that also supports regression testing similarly to traditional unit test suites.
