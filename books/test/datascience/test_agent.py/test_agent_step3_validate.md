# Agent Step 3: Validation

Agent validates the answer for quality and completeness


## Inherited State from Steps 1-2

Question: How do I test a multi-step ML pipeline with booktest?
Answer: Break the pipeline into independent stages and write one Booktest TestCaseRun that runs each stage on deterministic or sampled inputs, saving intermed...

### Validation Result

What works well: The answer gives a sensible, actionable high-level strategy—split the pipeline into stages, record intermediate artifacts, assert on stable metrics with tolerances, use sampling to keep tests fast, and escalate borderline cases to human review.  
Issues / missing information: It omits concrete examples and wiring (no code snippets showing how to save/load checkpoints, set seeds or control nondeterminism, or run Booktest in CI), and some API names (t.h1/t.iln/t.tln/t.tmetric/t.start_review etc.) should be verified against the official booktest docs because the exact call signatures and artifact/metric APIs aren’t shown; it also doesn’t discuss mocking, stubbing heavy components, or strategies for automating or gating human reviews.  
Overall assessment: Good — useful and practical guidance, but needs concrete code examples, precise API references, and extra details on reproducibility and CI integration to be fully actionable.
