Question: How do I test a multi-step ML pipeline with booktest?
Plan: - Highlight booktest features to use: TestCaseRun for structured tests (h1/tln for step headings), artifact logging (save intermediate outputs as CSV/...

### Generated Answer

Treat each pipeline stage as a mini-test inside a TestCaseRun (e.g., def test_pipe(t: bt.TestCaseRun):) using t.h1/tln to document steps and emitting intermediate artifacts (save as CSV/NDJSON) so you can inspect or diff them. Persist and reuse heavy work with booktest checkpoints/caching so integration and E2E runs reuse saved step outputs instead of recomputing everything. Test strategy: fast unit tests for each component with small deterministic inputs and mocked external calls, integration tests that chain a few stages while capturing intermediate artifacts, then full end‑to‑end runs judged with booktest’s review/diff UI and numeric thresholds (t.start_review(), t.tmetric()). For reproducibility and fast iteration, fix random seeds, mock external services, save golden/intermediate artifacts for regression comparisons, and reuse cached checkpoints; when a case fails, annotate it in the review UI to guide fixes.
