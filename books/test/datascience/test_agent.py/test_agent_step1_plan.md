### Question

How do I test a multi-step ML pipeline with booktest?


### Plan

- Relevant features: TestCaseRun (per-test context), saving intermediate artifacts/checkpoints or "snapshots" for human review, diffing/visualization of outputs, and metric/threshold checks to auto-fail obvious regressions.
- Key concepts to explain: break the pipeline into independent stages, use deterministic/sample inputs, capture and attach intermediate outputs for review (not just final output), combine automated checks (sanity metrics) with human review where needed, and keep tests fast by sampling.
- Order to present: 1) design — define inputs and per-stage expectations; 2) implementation — show a test that runs each stage, saves checkpoints/artifacts, computes simple metrics and calls t.review or stores snapshots; 3) validation — run end-to-end on a sample, inspect diffs/metrics, iterate.
