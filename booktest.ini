#
# This file is meant for project specific configuration like python paths and test file location
#
# This file should be included in the version control.
#

#
# the python_path is used to specify the directories where the python modules are located
#
# by default, it is 'src:.', which means that the src directory and the current directory are searched
#
python_path=.

#
# booktest automatically detects tests in the default_tests directories
#
test_paths=test

#
# booktest will run all default_tests test cases, if no argument is given
#
default_tests=test

#
# books_path specifies directory, where results and books are stored
#
books_path=books

#
# timeout specifies the test timeout in seconds for parallel runs.
#
timeout=3600

#
# Environment variables can be defined using pytest-compatible format.
# These variables are set before test discovery and module loading,
# allowing tests to read them during import.
# They are automatically cleaned up after test execution.
#
# Example (pytest-compatible format):
#   env =
#       API_KEY=test_key_123
#       DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///:memory:
#
# Legacy format also supported:
#   env_API_KEY=test_key_123
#
fs_version=v2
